## Lessons Learned

Challenges: 
* organizing information in a way where taking next steps to get everything down was clear
* realizing some sort of style guide / unity of visual design
* user experience/user flow

It might be more efficient to start client side, do mockups in terms of hardcoding copmonents and pages, and then deciding what API calls and endpoints need to be created.

## Next Steps

* Migrating to SQL/Database 
* Adding maps/geolocation/direction functionality
* Adding more content
* User Authenticaton/Login
* Refining the style guide for better visual cohesion
* Creating a better UI/UX experience for the user
* Glossary for Japanese terms to make the app more educational
