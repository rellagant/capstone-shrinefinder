# Project Title

Shrine Finder is a web application designed for tourists in Japan to discover lesser-known shrines that are off the beaten path. The app provides detailed information about each shrine, including unique features, associated deities, and available lucky charms (omamori) or shrine seals/calligraphy (goshuin).
>There are estimated to be around 80,000 shrines in Japan. - wiki

## Lessons Learned

Challenges: 
* time and organizing information in a way where taking next steps to get everything down was clear
* realizing some sort of style guide / unity of visual design
* thinking about user experience


It might be more efficient to start client side, do mockups in terms of hardcoding copmonents and pages, and then deciding what API calls and endpoints need to be created.

## Next Steps

* refining styling
* adding features including deleting posts
* adding content/considering migrating to database
* refining the style guide for better visual cohesion
* creating a better UI/UX experience for the user
* gathering content for database
* adding additional API calls for more features (geolocation/directions/glossary)
* deployment
